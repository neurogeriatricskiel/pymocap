# PyMoCap: Python for Motion Capture

In this repository a collection of scripts will be made publicly available for the analysis of motion capture data.  
At the Neurology department of the University Hospital Kiel (UKSH) we are working with both 
1. opto-electronic stereophotogrammetric systems, based on passive retro-reflective markers, hereafter referred to as optical motion capture (OMC) systems, and 
2. wearable inertial measurement unit (IMU) systems, usually containing a 3-axis accelerometer and 3-axis gyroscope.  

In-lab recordings are used to validate IMU-based algorithms where reference values are obtained from the OMC systems. In the long run, the IMU-based algorithms are to be used in the home environment to gain insight in real-world gait.
